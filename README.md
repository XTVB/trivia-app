You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Environments
Environment variables can be set in the environments directory. They are accessible through `process.env.REACT_APP_<VARIABLE-NAME>`. Npm start will automatically load the dev environment and Npm build will automatically load the prod environment, you can change this by editing the package.json scripts to point to different files.

## Build requirements
node-sass cannot be built on the tadnet gitlab so a packaged version is provided. If the version of node-sass used is incremented then a new binary should be found and updated.
